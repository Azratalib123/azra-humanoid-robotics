title: Start Docusaurus Development Server
stage: general
date: 2025-12-12
surface: agent
model: gemini-1.5-flash-latest
feature: none
branch: main
user: user
command: npm start

## Prompt

npm start

## Response snapshot

Docusaurus website is running at: http://localhost:3000/humanoid-robotics-book/

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Successfully started the Docusaurus development server.
- 🧪 Tests: No specific tests were run for this action as it's a server startup.
- 📁 Files: No files were created or modified.
- 🔁 Next prompts: User will interact with the running server or provide next instructions.
- 🧠 Reflection: The command timed out, but the server started successfully. This is expected behavior for long-running processes.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: Command timeout due to long-running process, but not an actual failure.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): N/A
