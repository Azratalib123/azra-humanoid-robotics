## Prompt

Perform a non-destructive cross-artifact consistency and quality analysis across spec.md, plan.md, and tasks.md after task generation.

## Response snapshot

I have analyzed the `spec.md`, `plan.md`, and `tasks.md` artifacts against the `constitution.md`. I produced a report identifying 1 critical issue, several high/medium severity issues, and provided recommended next actions.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Generated a detailed analysis report identifying critical inconsistencies.
- 🧪 Tests: No tests were run.
- 📁 Files: Read 4 files, no modifications.
- 🔁 Next prompts: User to decide on remediation.
- 🧠 Reflection: The PowerShell script for PHR creation failed, requiring fallback to manual creation.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: Script execution failed (CommandNotFoundException).
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Investigate why the create-phr.ps1 script is not found in the path.
